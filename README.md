## General info
Its common to check on multiple platforms before making an online purchase. I made this for myself for items I have already purchased before (recurring purchases like coffee) as an efficient way to do a quick lookup on both platforms. I ranked the output based on popularity as I find that metric to be what I would use for this use case. On Lazada, popularity is based on ratings while on Shopee, it is based on number of items sold.
